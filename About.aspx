            <h3>Get to know me</h3>
            <p>My name is Austin Salgat. I'm an engineer who recieved his Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Bachelors from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I live a pretty simple life and my interests have, for the most part, always been related to computers. I love programming in my free time or going for long walks with my best friend Fangfang. Occasionally, I also enjoy playing League of Legends and random computer games.</p>
            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I've spent a half a year in China, spread out over 3 visits. The cities visited include Shangai, Harbin, Dalian, Sanya, and Bozhou.</li>
                <li>The majority of my life I've lived in Michigan, and still visit back home to go camping every year. It's a very beautiful state.</li>
                <li>In addition to my two engineering degrees, I also have an Associates degree in Electronics Technology, enabling me to be an electronics technician (I even worked as one for a while).</li>
